I'm Ben, an experienced software developer from Christchurch, New Zealand. I'm also a unicyclist and love spoonerisms (ask me about *Prinderella and the Cince*).

I love writing readable Go and Python code, and I'm currently working on [GoAWK](https://benhoyt.com/writings/goawk/), my AWK interpreter written in Go. I also do a fair bit of [technical writing](https://benhoyt.com/writings/) over on my website.

I dabble in other open source projects, with small submissions to the Go programming language, and a minor but heavily-used addition to Python a number of years ago -- [the os.scandir() function](https://benhoyt.com/writings/scandir/), which sped up os.walk() by 2-10x.

If you use my projects or enjoy my writing, I'd love for you to [**sponsor me**](https://github.com/sponsors/benhoyt/) to help my personal projects stay well-maintained and to keep me motivated! Even a coffee's worth is a nice perk. Thanks! :-)
